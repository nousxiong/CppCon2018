## For Speakers - Submitting Materials

To submit your materials, email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) with a link or attachment (if they are small).

If possible, please submit your slides in PDF format. This will allow the widest group of people to read them easily. If that’s not possible, you may also submit PowerPoint (`.ppt`/`.pptx`) files and zipped folders containing Keynote or HTML. If you have any questions, just email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) and ask.

For source code, a `zip` or `tar.gz` is fine. Please do not include large files, and please ensure that all files can be distributed by CppCon to the public. You may mark your code as being placed in the public domain, or include a suitable license (e.g. BSD, MIT, Apache, LGPL, or GPL). We are relying on you to ensure the code is licensed appropriately.

To help make our job easier, please name your slide files as follows:

> Presentation Title - Speaker Name - CppCon 2018

Please avoid special characters in the filename, such as: `\/:*?"<>|`. For example, Herb Sutter's plenary presentation would be named "Meta – Thoughts on Generative C++ – Herb Sutter – CppCon 2017.pdf".

Don’t worry about the name for code archives as we will be unzipping them.
