* Welcome
** About Me (Jeff Trull)
- Organizer of the SF Emacs Meetup

** Rough Organization
- Individual Presentations
  - Not necessarily formal or with slides, can just be a demo
  - Let me know if you have one
  - Arguments about approaches encouraged
- Questions for the Group
  - Problems you're experiencing
  - Things you want to automate
  - These will be interleaved with presentations
- Just hanging out and sharing ideas
